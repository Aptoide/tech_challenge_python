# Technical Challenge Python

## PRE-REQUISITES üìù
To take this challenge you will need to build a minimal Python script. 
The script should perform the steps that an App Store usually performs when requesting an app. It consists of 3 requests to our APIs:

1. **Search for Apps** - displays available apps by browsing through categories or search keywords.
2. **Display App Details** - for a given app, show images, descriptions
3. **Download the App** - download the app file

## INSTRUCTIONS üìÉ

**Before the live session:** üë®‚Äçüíª
You are expected to work on this task on your own, without help or advice from others. If you need clarification please seek help from Aptoide by emailing the Recruitment team.

**During the live session (technical interview with Aptoide developers):** ü´±‚Äçü´≤üèæ
Walk through your code with the assessor, answering questions on the code and programming/design choices as requested by the assessor.

## CODING ASSIGNMENT üíª
Build a Python script capable of performing HTTP requests with the correct parameters defined below:
1. **Search** and display to the console the list of apps obtained from the API call using the following URL:
   ```
   https://ws75.aptoide.com/api/7/apps/get/store_name=apps/q=bWF4U2RrPTE5Jm1heFNjcmVlbj1ub3JtYWwmbWF4R2xlcz0yLjA/group_name=games/limit=10/offset=0/mature=false
   ```
   **EXTRA:** Can you print to the console the original value of "q" parameter assuming that on the URL above it is a base64 encoded query string that summarises device specifications?

2. **Display** to the console the details an app obtained in the previous response (e.g. com.fun.lastwar.gp). Use the following URL:
   ```
   https://ws75.aptoide.com/api/7/app/get/store_name=apps/q=bWF4U2RrPTE5Jm1heFNjcmVlbj1ub3JtYWwmbWF4R2xlcz0yLjA/package_name=com.fun.lastwar.gp/language=pt_PT/
   ```
 
3. **Download** the app file (APK) by requesting the following URL:
   ```
   https://aptoide-mmp.aptoide.com/api/v1/download/b2VtaWQ9VGVjaENoYWxsZW5nZVB5dGhvbiZwYWNrYWdlX25hbWU9Y29tLmZ1bi5sYXN0d2FyLmdwJnJlZGlyZWN0X3VybD1odHRwczovL3Bvb2wuYXBrLmFwdG9pZGUuY29tL2FwcHMvY29tLWZ1bi1sYXN0d2FyLWdwLTk5OTk5LTY2NjEyOTMwLWE3MThmOWZlMjE5OGM1Y2EyYzIwMmUwNDYzZTVkZDk1LmFwaw==?resolution=1080x1776
   ```
   OPPSSS... It seems someone forgot to add a mandatory parameter. Can you fix the previous URL by including the missing parameter with a dummy value (e.g. testchallenge)?


## EVALUATION CRITERIA ‚úÖ
- The correct execution of the 3 previous steps.
- Correctness of the script implementation (with clear and well structured code).
- Clarity of the README.md file (that explains how to run your script).

## SUBMISSION
Submit your project as a GitHub repository containing your code and the README.md and share the link with the Aptoide Recruitment team.
